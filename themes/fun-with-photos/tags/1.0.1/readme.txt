If you are reading this then I am already dead. Under your seat you will find a case. Do not open it!

= Fun with Photos - Habari Photoblog theme =

This is a really simply photoblog theme.

== Licence ==

This is licensed under Apache Software License (http://www.apache.org/licenses/)

== Posting photos ==

The theme splits all posts into two parts, the photo and the accompanying information. The photo is displayed first and the extra info, along with the comments, can be seen by clicking the link beneath the photo.

There are two options for posting the photo and additional information:

=== Option 1 - No plugin ===

When you create your post you need to include the image HTML at the top. After that line add <!--details-->.
Everything after <!--details--> will appear on the second screen.

=== Option 2 - With the plugin ===

In the theme folder there is another folder called "Fun with photos plugin". To use this copy it into the Habari plugins directory and activate it as normal.

Once activated you will find that your post page has a new text box for the image URL. The Habari Silo will also have an extra option: Use Photo, that will insert the image URL into that box for you.

If you use this method then everything in the normal post box will be extra text that is separated out onto the second page.

== Changing the title graphic ==

Included with the theme is a folder called PSD. In it you will find a photoshop document with the blog title in it so you can change it.

== Versions ==

= 1.0.1 =

Added a single line of CSS to remove the outlines on the next and previous links.

Enjoy
