		<value><![CDATA[<p>Once activated, this plugin stores and updates a view count for individual posts,
and can be configured to count only users who are not logged in.</p>
<p>It provides a block that can be configured with the number of posts to show.
Its template, <tt>block.popular_posts.php</tt>, can be copied to a theme directory and modified.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This plugin can also be used without using the block, as below:</strong></p>
<p>To output a list of popular posts, insert this code where you want them to appear:</p>
<blockquote><code>&lt;?php $theme-&gt;popular_posts(); ?&gt;</code></blockquote>
<p>You can also pass the number of popular posts you want to retrieve:</p>
<blockquote><code>&lt;?php $theme-&gt;popular_posts( 7 ); ?&gt;</code></blockquote>
<p>This will retrieve the seven most popular posts. The default is five.</p>
<p>The default theme inserts an HTML unordered list of links to the popular
pages. If you want to alter this, you should copy the <tt>popular_posts.php</tt>
template included with this plugin to your current theme directory and make changes to it there.</p>]]></value>
