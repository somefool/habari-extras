Plugin: markUp
URL: http://habariproject.org
Version: 0.4
Author: Habari Project

Purpose 

markUp provides a simple text editor for those of us who want the productivity improvements of not having to type in all our own markup tags, but don't want to use a wysiwyg editor. markUp gives you the choice of using html or markdown as your markup language.

Out of the box markUp provides easy insertion of all header tags, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, bold, emphasis, images, and links.

Requirements 

Just activate it.

Installation

1. Copy the plugin directory into your user/plugins directory or the site's plugins directory.
2. Go to the plugins page of your Habari admin panel.
3. Click on the Activate button for markItUp.
4. Configure the plugin. It defaults to having a simple skin for the editor, and using html as the markup language.

Uninstallation

1. Got to the plugins page of your Habari admin panel.
2. Click on the Deactivate button.
3. Delete the markItUp directory from your user/plugins directory.
4. Delete the plugins configuration entries from the Options table.

Cleanup

markUp adds entries to the Options table of your database. These are all prefixed with the work 'Markup'. If you are uninstalling the plugin completely, these entries can be safely removed.
