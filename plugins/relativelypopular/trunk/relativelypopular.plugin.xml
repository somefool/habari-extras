		<value><![CDATA[<p>Once activated, this plugin stores and updates a view count for individual posts,
				on a rolling basis of a configurable number of days (default: 30) and can be configured to 
				count only users who are not logged in.</p>
			<p>You can add a list of the most popular articles to your site by adding the 'Relatively Popular Posts' block in an appropriate place.</p>
			<p>After your pages have started to collect some data, why not show a small graph on your page by editing your theme to include the code: <tt>$RelativelyPopular->sparkline($content);</tt></p>]]></value>
