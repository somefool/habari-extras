			by default disables delete/remove of both core and other options. Editing
			is always allowed, except renaming an option name qualifies as deleting the
			old one, so appropriate delete permissions are required for that.

		<p>
			Remember:
			These configure options are mainly here to help decrease (or increase) the
			chances of you messing something up (e.g., accidentally delete a core option)
			but they aren't 100% intelligent. In other words, this plugin makes guesses
			regarding the option type (e.g., core, plugin, theme) and whether or not it's
			active. Unfortunately [currently] Habari allows plugins to pollute the Options
			namespace, so it's difficult to determine status with 100% accuracy.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			You can <strong>always</strong> edit options, even when none of the delete
			checkboxes are checked.
