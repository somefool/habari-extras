		<p>You will need an <a href="http://defensio.com/signup">API key from defensio</a> for the
		filter to work. Enter the API key Defensio gives you in the Configuration.</p>
		
		<p>You can also choose to announce new blog posts you make to Defensio to help Defensio
		determine what is and what is not spam. The information sent to Defensio is as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Author Name: The username of the posts author.</li>
			<li>Author Email: The email address of the posts author.</li>
			<li>Article Title: The title you give your post.</li>
			<li>Article Content: The content of your post.</li>
			<li>Permalink: The URI to the post.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>You can also choose weather or not to automatically approve comments that Defensio does
		not think are spam. This means comments not marked as spam will show up immediately on your
		site.</p>
		
		<p>This plugin also uses a queue system to queue comments to be scanned in case the Defensio
		servers go down. The plugin will retry the scan every 30 seconds for a total of 6 times. 
		Theses queued comments will show in the comments admin page marked in blue. If the Defensio
		servers do infact fail to respond within the 6 retries, the comment will be marked 
		unapproved and show in your moderation queue for you to decide.</p>
