Hi, Thank you for trying out my polling pluin.

To call this plugin one should type in the theme:
 
" <?php $theme->poll(arguments); ?> "

So far, one can type the poll id to select individual posts, or leave the arguments blank to get the latest poll.


As of now, There is a default poll.single.php

One can create that file in there theme that will override this.

Use the demo in the polls plugin dir.
