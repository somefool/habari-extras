Hi, Thank you for trying out my polling plugin.

To call this plugin one should type in the theme:
 
" <?php $theme->poll(arguments); ?> "

So far, one can type the poll id to select individual posts, or leave the arguments blank to get the latest poll.


The Top of the widget links to the polls respective page.
One needs a poll.single.php for this link to work.

This is still in Alpha mode, and I am working hard to add more and more features.
